# Designing a Traffic Signal Control System

## Requirements
- The traffic signal system should control the flow of traffic at an intersection with multiple roads.
- The system should support different types of signals, such as red, yellow, and green.
- The duration of each signal should be configurable and adjustable based on traffic conditions.
- The system should handle the transition between signals smoothly, ensuring safe and efficient traffic flow.
- The system should be able to detect and handle emergency situations, such as an ambulance or fire truck approaching the intersection.
- The system should be scalable and extensible to support additional features and functionality.
